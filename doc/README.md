# VideoPlay Dart Library Documentation

## Common API

The `videoplay.dart` library has a common API to interact with videos, which
is detailed [here](common.md).

For most cases, it's sufficient to use the direct method.


## Video Type

Each kind of video player has its own documentation on how to use it:

* [YouTube](youtube.md)
* [HTML 5](html5.md)
* [Vimeo](vimeo.md)
* [Twitch](twitch.md)
* [Create your own provider](extend.md)
