# Example for controlling a single video player

This `videoplay.dart` example shows how a video player is added to the web page
at startup, then allows the user to change out the video, and have limited
control over playback by using the Dart controls.

Note that this uses `<video-player>`.  If you instead use `<video>`, then you'll
be referencing HTML 5 videos directly, with its own usage that's completely
different.
